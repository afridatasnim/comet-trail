HackUTD VIII project. Mobile app to help students plan out their degree plan.
Comet Trail is an application that recommends classes for an upcoming semester to UTD students based on the previous classes they have attended. 
The application takes in the major, the amount of hours to take, the maximum hours that a student wants to take, and the max specific hours that 
a student wants to take.

Future iterations of the app could recommend taking summer classes or provide tutorials on how to sign up for classes through UTD Orion.
